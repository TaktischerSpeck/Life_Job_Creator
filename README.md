Version 5.0 of [Altis Life RPG Framework](https://github.com/AsYetUntitled/Framework/) by <b>TAW_Tonic</b>

Java https://www.java.com/de/download/

### Installing

Simply Install Java and than run the .jar file with Java.

!!IMPORTANT!!

Go in your mission and open the Config_vItems.hpp located in [MISSION]\config\Config_vItems.hpp

At the End of the class VirtualShops you got two lines wich should look like this:
```
    };
};
```
change them to:
```    
    };
    
};
```

Just create an new, Empty line.

Its needed that the tool can separate the VirtualShops class from the VirtualItems class.
